# Calculator
SVN Repo converted to Git.

This is a project for my degree where I am builing a Calculator which can evaluate an expression in either infix or postfix. It was made in Eclipse IDE and is set up as a Maven project. JavaDoc is also utilized to document the code. I utilize the Shunting Yard Algorithm to allow me to convert any infix notation to postfix. The postfix expression is then evaluated. I also leaerned how to use vcs with this assignment as I used svn.
